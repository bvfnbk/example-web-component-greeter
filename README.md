# Example Web Components

This repository contains a number of different (vanilla) web components. It is a workspace intended for proof of
concepts, ideas and the research for best practices when doing without the many component frameworks like _React_, 
_Angular_ and _VueJS_ to name but a few.

## Overview

1. [`<hello-message>` Greeter](./hello-message/README.md) - the most simple web component.
  - Basic setup.
  - Lifecycle: `attributeChangedCallback`
  - Tests with _Karma JS_ and _Jasmine_
