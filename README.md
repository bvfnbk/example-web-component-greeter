# Example Web Components

This repository contains a number of different (vanilla) web components. It is a workspace intended for proof of
concepts, ideas and the research for best practices when doing without the many component frameworks like _React_, 
_Angular_ and _VueJS_ to name but a few.

The order of the web components actually matters: later modules add concepts to earlier modules. Sources are shamelessly
copied and adapted from earlier modules

## Overview

1. [Vanilla JavaScript Web Component](./hello-message/README.md)
   - Test with _Karma_ and _Jasmine_
2. [Vanilla TypeScript Web Component](./ts-hello-message/README.md)
   - Test with _Karma_ and _Jasmine_
3. [Simple Event Handling](./input-element/README.md)
   - Custom event
   - Test with _Karma_ and _Jasmine_

## Roadmap

- Create a Bundle
- Development Mode (watch sources, rebuild on change, reload modules)
- Tagged Templates (building the template element...)

etc.
